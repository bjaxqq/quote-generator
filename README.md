## Stoic Quotes API

When composing the idea for this small project, I was thinking of ways on how I was going to generate a list of specific stoic quotes and luckily someone had already done the job of creating an API to get an immense number of them. [Ben Honeywill](https://github.com/benhoneywill) create a much better website than I did and his [API](https://stoic-quotes.com/api/quote) is super useful if you are working on a project involving quotes specifically focused on the ideas and beliefs of stoicism.
